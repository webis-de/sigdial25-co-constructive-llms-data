The explanations about specific rules, like how players don't choose their own pieces and the different ways to form a quarto, were particularly helpful. The follow-up questions and responses also provided deeper insight into strategy, like the importance of blocking an opponent\u2019s row or anticipating moves. The breakdown of the game\u2019s rules in small sections, like the number of pieces needed to form a quarto and the specifics of the board setup, was useful for digesting each part of the game step by step.\r\n\r\nThe open-ended approach to answering questions helped me feel more comfortable asking for additional clarification, which deepened my understanding."

An example of this would be can the opposing player place a piece next to yours which share a similar trait? Or can you win by another persons row. Since this is a two player game each with an equal set of pieces on both side common sense would dictate the answer to be yes, but I cannot be sure of this since it wasnt covered in the tutorial."

Additionally by writing out the chain of events it allowed repeated it would allow me to come back to this should I need to leave it for an amount of time. Lastly I thought it was a nice touch that after I had made the move, they explained the advantages of the move that I had made. However I do wish they explained more of the rules, but I think that was my fault becuase i didnt ask enough questions simply because I ran out of time."
